# Etsy Bot 
A bot that collects daily sales in your store on Etsy and creates an Excel table. With web scrapping, you can log into your Etsy account and retrieve all sales made on that date for the dates you want and output them as Excel.

#### NOTES:
- Make sure your web driver is up to date.
- Enter your password and email address in the appropriate places in the bot1.py file.
- After logging in, it waits for 15 seconds. This period was used as a precaution against the emergence of recaptcha. If a recaptcha appears, you must solve it within 15 seconds.
